				text: 'My name is Jonas, and I am a 17-year-old student currently studying at HTBLA Leonding in Austria. I am pursuing a field of study in IT/Mediatechnology, and I have a keen interest in programming, especially web development. Aside from my native language, German, I am also fluent in English, with a B+ level of proficiency. I have experience working with various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Java, ShellScript, JavaScript & NodeJS, PHP, and Oracle SQL. Recently, I have discovered the Svelte JS-framework and learned Svelte along with SvelteKit. I have also gained expertise in working with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI. I am always eager to learn new programming languages and frameworks, and I am passionate about developing efficient, user-friendly websites and applications. I am constantly exploring ways to improve my skills and knowledge in the field of web development, and I am determined to achieve my career goals in the world of IT and programming. With dedication and enthusiasm, I believe that I have what it takes to succeed in this field.'
